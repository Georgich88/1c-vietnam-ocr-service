## 1. About
Version: 0.1.0-1   
Service provides REST API to recognize documents using OCR library Tessaract

## 2. Tessaract

**Tesseract** is an open-source OCR engine developed by **HP** that recognizes more than 100 languages, along with the
support of ideographic and right-to-left languages. Also, we can train Tesseract to recognize other languages. It
contains two OCR engines for image processing â€“ a LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) OCR engine, and a legacy OCR engine that
works by recognizing character patterns.

## 3. Spring Boot

**Spring Boot** makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".
We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries, so you can get started with minimum fuss.
Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.
